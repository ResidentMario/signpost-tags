This is all well and good; we always need new checks and balances to be sure we're excluding the right articles. But there's a problem; the two lists use different algorithms to arrive at their numbers, which means that, while the actual entrants on each list are the same, their counts can differ by more than 100,000 views. This doesn't tend to affect the top articles, which are usually too far apart for the differences to matter. But once you get down to the mid-and-bottom end, where the numbers are closer together, it's a sandstorm. This becomes particularly problematic when deciding which articles are actually in the Top 25 in the first place. So. Lacking any actual information regarding which algorithms are correct, I decided the best course of action was to split the difference. Literally. I added the numbers up, divided by two and whichever numbers resulted, that was the order I put them in. Which means that the current list is based on numbers in both data sets.\",\n",

Anecdotally, it seems to have received far less press coverage than recent disasters like Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which remained on the chart for five weeks after occurring in March 2014. This is not a case of a disaster happening at the end of a week such that it only shows up the following week, its views were highest on May 19, and have dropped daily since.
