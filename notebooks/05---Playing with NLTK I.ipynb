       " 'Echoing McHenry\\\\\\'s observations about Alexander Hamilton being \"edited into mediocrity\", boyd suggested the quality of collaborative work was overrated: \"Wikipedia appears to be a legitimate authority on a vast array of topics for which only one individual has contributed material.',\n",

       " \"The most recent fundraising drive, which coincided with the milestone of reaching 1 million Wikipedia articles, raised over US $50,000 to support site operations.\\\\nThe planned fundraiser was initially scheduled to coincide with Wikipedia\\\\'s anniversary this month, as announced last Tuesday by Volunteer Representative Trustee Angela Beesley.\",\n",
       " 'She suggested that in preparation, the sitewide notice for the fundraiser could benefit from improvements, and mentioned the possibility of sending out a press release for the fundraiser and anniversary.\\\\nBeesley added that developer Tim Starling is working on a database that will allow the Foundation to start accepting memberships.',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile, a quarterly budget for the use of these funds is also in the works.\\\\nResponses to the announcement indicated that the timing of the fundraiser was a bad idea.',\n",

       " 'Wikipedia itself has been contributing to the situation by having a prominent link on the Main Page to information about donations to the relief effort.\\\\nWith these considerations in mind, Member Representative Trustee Anthere indicated that the Foundation could afford to wait a little bit.',\n",

       " 'Until Reynolds commented on it, nobody had bothered to do anything about the picture, although the fakery was noted on the talk page.\\\\nThe \"puppy-blender\" story has a longer history, as it was originally promoted in April 2003 by Frank J. on the IMAO blog as a \"filthy lie\" for people to tell about Reynolds.',\n",
       " \"Since then, the joke/lie has had a fair amount of circulation in the blogosphere, and its over-the-top nature makes it fairly easy to detect as falsehood, even if the teller doesn\\\\'t actually point this out.\\\\nAs the Instapundit article is regularly visited by vandals, this story naturally makes popular fodder for their material.\",\n",
       " 'The story has often been added as if it were fact, and on other occasions simply mentioned as being a story told about Reynolds.',\n",
       " 'Either way it has regularly been removed again by people monitoring the article.\\\\nTraffic moves in both directions\\\\nBy blogging about these issues, Reynolds managed to drive some additional traffic to the Instapundit article, some of which continued the vandalism.',\n",
       " 'Finally, administrator Violetriga protected the article for about 24 hours.',\n",
       " \"Since the unprotection of the page, things have calmed down, but a picture to illustrate the article is still lacking.\\\\nApparently Reynolds also got some feedback from people who didn\\\\'t take kindly to his comments, much like some other media figures have noted receiving flames when they publish material that is critical of Wikipedia.\",\n",
       " 'In any case, Reynolds later updated his blog to add, \"I didn\\\\\\'t mean for the original post to be a big slam on Wikipedia, just a comment on a not-very-reliable post.',\n",
